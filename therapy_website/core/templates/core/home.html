        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a psychotherapeutic counsellor, working in southeast and central London, both face-to-face and online.</p>
        <p>As a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy), I adhere to their ethical framework and standards.</p>
        <p>I hold an Advanced Diploma in Integrative Humanistic Counselling from CPPD. I have studied a variety of approaches to therapy, including transactional analysis, gestalt and CBT. As part of my training I worked in a range of placements, gaining hundreds of hours of valuable experience with a wide range of clients.</p>
        <p>I am always developing my way of working through discussions with colleagues, training workshops and by reading the latest literature. This is particularly important as many clients are dealing with issues acutely influenced by modern life and changes in the way we currently connect with others.</p>
        <p>I currently work voluntarily with southeast London Mind alongside my private practice.</p>
        <p>My background is in the performing arts and education.</p>
        <p>I value difference and diversity in my practice.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I work in depth, combining a range of ideas and methods to help you achieve your therapeutic goals, bringing light to the complexities of your relationships, your early life and internal thought patterns. This might involve exploring how your childhood and early attachment has moulded your present way of relating with others; or examining the interplay between your thoughts, feelings and behaviours; or perhaps we will aim to observe your experience of the present moment in the room and in the space between us. At your wish, we might pay attention to your inner child, or envision and even act out situations with people in your life or parts of yourself.</p>
        <p>I work on the assumption that you have an innate desire to develop and learn more about yourself. I offer a helping hand in guiding you in the right direction. I can offer you a pristine, non-judgemental relationship that is yours to use to heal, learn and to grow. Above all, I would hope to offer you a meaningful experience that feels different to other relationships in your life, one that feels spacious and open, so that you can take it in whichever direction you choose.</p>
        <p>By working in with the core beliefs that define how you see yourself, we might bring about lasting change, so that aspects of you that feel dispiritingly fixed and rigid become more fluid and eventually ebb away.</p>

        <h2>Sessions</h2>
        <p>Therapy is different for everyone. Some people come with a clear issue they want to work through, while others just need a space to figure things out as they go. However we approach it, this will be a collaborative process - led by you, supported and shaped together.</p>
        <p>Once you contact me, I will aim to reply as soon as possible. We will set up a Zoom or phone call so that you can tell me about yourself and we can work out if I can help. We will arrange to meet weekly at a time of your choosing. We might commit to a certain number of sessions so that we have a clear aim, but you will be free to end the work at any time, or to continue to work long-term.</p>
        <p>I offer sessions in-person in <strong>Telegraph Hill</strong>(close to Peckham/New Cross/Brockley), in <strong>London Bridge</strong>, or online <strong>via Zoom</strong>. Sessions are usually weekly. I charge £60 per session, unless in London Bridge, in which case £70.</p>
        <p>If you’re thinking about therapy, I’d be happy to hear from you.</p>
